## Description

This adds a smokestack entity to the `Entities` menu, under `Smoke Stack`.

### Features

- Animatable properties using Stop Motion Helper

### Rational

From my awareness, there does not exist a method to spawn a customizable `env_smokestack`, although I have seen some coders spawn these for other purposes. Strangely enough, in the making of this addon, smokestack-like particles did not exist in the Advanced Particle Controller. The lack of such tools, plus the requirement for smoke particles in my own posters and animations, necessitated the creation of this addon.

## Pull Requests

When making a pull request, make sure to confine to the style seen throughout. Try to add types for new functions or data structures. I used the default [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) formatting style.
